along the river,
where —in places,
it becomes
overlarge; thin;
or even
---
winding (of course)
Yoshida remains
focused, rowing in
places wherein
it's become
a hydrae mission:
keep going forward
keep forgoing ward
keep farrowing
avoid the dog
go! void death
listen for a voice
no! have odd ti
ming -interrupt
yourself,
“permit turning!”
you

surly foe-
ye of slur,

fly! or use
the oar
make sure to
make routes
for a son to follow:
a wake in the water
And so Ray, here
awake on wet earth
dreams
of a different path
asleep in the dirt
as
a reenlisted pith;
a boomeranged nut;
a bell rerung and waiting

to be
reborn as
a gilded nephrite
the core or
the ore or
the jade who
hated how je
alously he
waited for the hammer
to either ring or shatter

but now, Ray-
brawny, out

rowing himself,
forming wishle
ss flowers with

wolfish wrests-
lupine yanking,

inanely puking
for too much
rowing,
howling,
roweling,
urging, "get going!"
